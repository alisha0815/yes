        <h2>Why You Should Use Good Coding Practices</h2>
        <p>
            Using good practices feels like an <strong>intuitive</strong> thing – if it’s something good, then you should definitely use it, right? Unfortunately, my experience has vastly proven that that isn’t necessarily the case in the software development world. As I pointed out before, many developers sacrifice some of these practices to meet deadlines or decrease work. 
            However, the short-term gains they can get from ignoring these practices pale before the benefits those developers could be getting if they adhere to them. Some of those benefits include:

        <h2>Better Workflow:</h2>
        <p>
        Following good practices streamlines all development processes, as the whole team is on the same page about the work they are doing. Teams that follow these practices have better communication, understand each other’s roles, and have better possibilities at prioritizing the work, making the whole life cycle run smooth
        </p>
        <h2>Increased Efficiency and Productivity:</h2>
        <p>
        When an entire team follows good coding practices, everyone has a better overall understanding of the project, which leads to fewer errors and a reduced need for constant fixes. That maximizes the efficiency of everything developers code, which ultimately translates into a boost in productivity.
